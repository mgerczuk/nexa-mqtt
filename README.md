`nexa-mqtt` is a standalone application designed to retrieve data and metrics from your Growatt NEXA 2000 home battery used in balcony power plants. It publishes this information to an MQTT broker, making it easily accessible for Home Assistant or other applications. It is a fork of https://github.com/mtrossbach/noah-mqtt.

The application features Home Assistant auto-discovery, allowing your NEXA devices to be automatically recognized and integrated with Home Assistant via the MQTT integration.

# Configuration

`nexa-mqtt` supports three API modes:

*   **`app`**: (previous default) This mode utilizes the Shine App APIs.  These APIs offer faster data updates and support setting parameters. However, they are the least stable, as they are prone to change with new app updates.  They are also subject to strict rate limits, which may result in IP bans.
*   **`web`**: This mode uses the Growatt Website APIs. These APIs provide a more stable way to fetch data.  Setting parameters is not supported in this mode.
*   **`web+app`**: (current default) This mode combines the best of both worlds. It uses the Growatt Website APIs for data fetching (for stability) and the App APIs for setting parameters.


You can configure `nexa-mqtt` using the following environment variables:

}
```

## Setting Device Parameters

You can update the device's parameter settings by posting a message to the following topic:

- **Topic:** `nexa2mqtt/{DEVICE_SERIAL}/parameters/set`
- **Description:** Send configuration settings to this topic to update the device's parameters.
- **Example:** `nexa2mqtt/1234567890/parameters/set`
- **Example Payload:**
```json
{
   "charging_limit": 100, // battery charging limit in percent, between 70 and 100
   "discharge_limit": 9, // battery discharge limit in percent, between 0 and 30
   "default_output_w": 800, // desired system AC output power in watts, between 0 and 800 in steps of 10 
   "default_mode": "load_first", // or battery_first
   "allow_grid_charging": "OFF", // ON when battery may be charged from grid
   "grid_connection_control": "OFF", // ON for off-grid mode
   "ac_couple_power_control": "OFF", // ON for 1000W max. AC output. (Power+ Function)
                                     // Note: this may be forbidden when connected to
                                     // public grid!
   "light_load_enable": "OFF", // ON allows the device to discharge at low power for
                               // extended periods. (AC Always On)
   "never_power_off": "OFF", // When ON the device remains powered on and never shuts down
                             // while connected to the grid. (Always On)
                             // "allow_grid_charging" should be ON for this function
   "anti_backflow_enable": "OFF", //When ON export to grid is limited
   "anti_backflow_power_percentage": 20 // Seems to be max. allowed backflow in percent
                                        // of maximum output (800/1000W)
}
```

You can set a property individually or any combination of properties. The value pairs `charging_limit`, `discharge_limit` and `default_output_w`, `default_mode` are set together. If one of them is missing in the payload the cached previous value is used. A debounce timer of 500 ms is used to combine payloads with individual properties to a combined payload. That means that any setting of a value is executed after a delay of 500 ms.

The application will connect to your MQTT broker and retrieve all metrics and data for your NEXA devices.

## Option 2: Downloading and running a Debian package

1. **Download the deb package file**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/mgerczuk/nexa-mqtt/releases) page of the repository and download the .deb file for your operating system and system architecture.

2. **Install the package**

   ```sh
   sudo apt install -f <deb-file>
   ```

When there is an update simply download the new deb package file and install with the same install command.

nexa-mqtt is started and will be started automatically after a reboot. Check with `journalctl -t nexa-mqtt` if there are any problems, e.g. user name or password errors.

You can modify the environment variables by executing

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl edit nexa-mqtt
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart nexa-mqtt
   ```
To uninstall the package execute `sudo apt remove nexa-mqtt`.

## Option 3: Downloading and running a prebuilt binary

If you prefer not to compile the binary yourself, you can download a prebuilt version:

1. **Download the Binary**: Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/mgerczuk/nexa-mqtt/releases) page of the repository and download the prebuilt binary for your operating system and system architecture.

2. **Extract the Binary**: If the binary is compressed (e.g., in a zip or tar file), extract it to a directory of your choice.

3. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal in the directory containing the binary and run it using the appropriate command for your OS, setting the necessary environment variables:

   - **Windows** (Command Prompt):

# Integration into HomeAssistant

## Run standalone (Home Assistant Container, Home Assistant Core)
`nexa-mqtt` interacts with Home Assistant by publishing data from your Growatt NEXA 2000 home battery to an MQTT broker. This setup allows Home Assistant to subscribe to and integrate this data seamlessly into its ecosystem.

![Home Assistant Integration](./assets/nexa-mqtt-ha-dark.drawio.png#gh-dark-mode-only)
![Home Assistant Integration](./assets/nexa-mqtt-ha.drawio.png#gh-light-mode-only)

If you’re already using MQTT with other integrations like zigbee2mqtt or AhoyDTU, you already have the MQTT integration configured and active. In this case, you can skip step 1 and 2 as your existing setup should work with `nexa-mqtt`.

The following integration process for `nexa-mqtt` with Home Assistant works for all installation methods, regardless of how Home Assistant is installed—whether it’s through Home Assistant OS, Home Assistant Supervised, or Home Assistant Container. 

1. **Set Up an MQTT Broker**:  
   Ensure you have an MQTT broker running, such as [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), and that it’s accessible from both nexa-mqtt and Home Assistant.

2. **Check MQTT Integration in Home Assistant**:  
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.
   - Click **Add Integration** and select „MQTT“.
   - Enter your MQTT broker details (hostname, port, username, password).
   - Test the connection to ensure it’s working correctly.

3. **Run nexa-mqtt**:  
   Start `nexa-mqtt` using the appropriate configuration for your MQTT broker.

4. **Verify Device Discovery**:  
   Check **Devices** and **Entities** under **Settings** > **Devices & Services** in Home Assistant to confirm that your Noah devices are automatically discovered.

By following these steps, `nexa-mqtt` will communicate with Home Assistant via your MQTT broker, also supporting automatic device discovery. If you already have MQTT set up, it should integrate seamlessly with your existing configuration.

# Integration into OpenHAB

`nexa-mqtt` interacts with OpenHAB by publishing data from your Growatt NEXA 2000 home battery to an MQTT broker. This setup allows OpenHAB to subscribe to and integrate this data seamlessly into its ecosystem.

`nexa-mqtt` uses Home Assistant auto-discover. OpenHAB has some problems with this, especially you cannot properly set a '**Switch**' channel data imported from HA auto-discovery. Be sure to set the environment variable `HOMEASSISTANT_SWITCH_AS_SELECT` to `True` when you use OpenHAB. The 'switch' entities will then be imported as **String** channels.

![Home Assistant Integration](./assets/nexa-mqtt-openhab-dark.drawio.png#gh-dark-mode-only)
![Home Assistant Integration](./assets/nexa-mqtt-openhab.drawio.png#gh-light-mode-only)

1. **Set Up an MQTT Broker**:  
   Ensure you have an MQTT broker running, such as [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), and that it’s accessible from both nexa-mqtt and OpenHAB.

2. **Check MQTT Integration in OpenHAB**: 
   If not already done install the MQTT Binding from the Add-on Store

3. **Run nexa-mqtt**:  
   Start `nexa-mqtt` using the appropriate configuration for your MQTT broker and the environment variable `HOMEASSISTANT_SWITCH_AS_SELECT` to `True`.

4. **Device Discovery**:  
   OpenHAB should now show a new thing in the inbox on the **Settings**/**Things** page. Click on the inbox, select the entry an chose **Add as Thing**. Enter a name for the new thing. The thing should now be **online** and you can start linking items to the channels.

   In case the thing does not go online first check the MQTT broker and the MQTT binding. If that is Ok, try to disable/enable the thing and/or restart `nexa-mqtt`.
